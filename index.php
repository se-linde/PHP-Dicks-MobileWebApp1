<h1>Hi. I'm Sara Dwayne Linde.</h1>
   

    <p>I'm a Web Developer, who is interested in both Front-End and Back-End Development. I have 15 years of experience as a Software Test Engineer, and I think that that gives me a great insight into the development process, that other developers are missing. I am interested in either Full Time or Part Time work.
